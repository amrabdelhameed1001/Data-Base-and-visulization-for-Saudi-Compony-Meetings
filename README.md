# Data-Base-and-visulization-for-Saudi-Compony-Meetings
 A project to follow-up the meetings of a Saudi group of companies:
- The first page: the agenda of the meeting for the week, which includes all the data such as the title of the meeting, its purpose, the points that will be discussed, the tasks assigned to each person, the rate of completion, and the recommendations of the meeting.

- The second page is for attendance and absence, in front of each person's name, there are three boxes that monitor either his presence, his absence, or his excused absence, with a chart showing that.

- The third page is charts of the result of each person's work and the completion of his tasks or not.

- The fourth page includes general statistics for employee attendance and their completion rate.

Note: The data and identity of the company group have been changed.
